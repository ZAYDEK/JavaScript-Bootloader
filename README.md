# The problem
The idea and inspiration for this subtle tool is to allow websites to **build themselves**, injecting their dependencies into the DOM client-side, versus pre-compiling webpages. This idea can be thought of as a website 'bootstrapping' (or bootloading) itself into existence. LOL wait wut? That sounds like a terrible idea, no??

Here's the shtick: [NPM](https://npmjs.com) has a terrible developer-experience. Terrible! And what I mean is, I shouldn't need to download hundreds(!) if not thousands(!!) of files to build and ship a website, and I shouldn't have to wait minutes to download extraneous dependencies to get started, either. This is madness, is it not?

So as I see it, something about mainstream frontend web development is broken. See [How it feels to learn JavaScript in 2016](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f). This seminal ~article~ masterpiece puts into perspective the existential threat that is JavaScript run amok. Think about the children, man.

# The NPM-less solution. Huzzah! ðŸ™Œ
The need at hand is websites and their dependencies; e.g. CSS, JS, etc. Now, because I don't want to be bothered with a command-line/build-process when developing a website, because these ideas should be extricable from one another, the one prerequisite I do have for this is that it needs to just work.

Here's how:
```
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <script
       id="head"
      src="scripts/head.js" title="ðŸš€ Launch" dev
    ></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script
       id="body"
      src="scripts/body.js"
    ></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
ðŸ˜€ There's nothing left to do but run the damn thing. Ooh that feels good!!

So what's is we're leveraging JavaScript to let the website build itself into existence. ðŸ’¡ While it does add a negligible ~10ms, there is a significant benefit: it can be programmed! This is significant because we've deferred the 'build-process' the same environment as the websiteâ€“â€“the website! And this makes the development experience orthogonal.

Take a closer look at this line:
```
<script id="head" src="scripts/head.js" title="ðŸš€ Launch" dev></script>
```

`id` and `src` are nothing new, but what IS new is the addition of `title` and `dev`, which are non-standard attributes. Using this technique, we can treat user-defined attributes as arguments to customize our 'build-less build-process'. And this means our build-process can still be as simple or complex as required.

# Test it!
This is an experimental idea meant to inspire frontend developers simultaneous to shaming them for NPM glut. In this demo, I inject multiple CSS and JS dependencies (even [Vue](https://vuejs.org)!) to demonstrate this works. Look, NPM is cool, but I don't want to force frontend developers to conform for the sake of conformingâ€“â€“experiment!

Open `index.html` via [RawGit](https://rawgit.com) at https://rawgit.com/zaydek/JavaScript-Bootloader/master/index.html. You can learn more about this technique here: [using RawGit to serve repos](https://github.com/ZAYDEK/Stateless-Repos#one-other-weird-trick-). If hello, world! appears, it works! That's it. ðŸ’¯ See how in `scripts/head.js`, `scripts/body.js`, and `scripts/main.js`.

You might be thinking ... that's it?? But that's sort of the point: our `index.html` is now minimalistic (instead of maximalistic), we have an idiom for customizing our website's build-process, and it works with frameworks, too! ðŸŽ‰ Defining our own processes might seem weird, but if it can in turn make us more productive, shouldn't we make ~mistakes~ solutions?

# Gotchas
There appears to be one (surprising) gotchaâ€“â€“unrelated to the bootloader but is affected. That being that Safari can't deal with elements that use `const` or `var` that share an ID in common, see https://stackoverflow.com/a/41195385, e.g. `<div id="app">` and `const app = ...`. Weird, right? Here's a simple fix: `var app = new Vue({ .... })`.
